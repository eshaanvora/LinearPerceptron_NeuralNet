## Linear Perceptron
Neural Networks: Linear Perceptron

This repo contains programs that implement a linear perceptron in Python

'linearPerceptron.py' will run AS MANY EPOCHS AS NEEDED until weights do not update anymore, indicating that training is complete and will print the weights at each epoch until training completes

'linearPerceptron_ManualEpoch.py' will run a SPECIFIED NUMBER of epochs and print the weights of the linear perceptron at the specified epoch

In these programs the goal is to learn the weights, such that every feature, x, is mapped to the correct label

Uses update rule, at a specified learning rate, to update weights, until labels are mapped correctly
